# YTMPwhatever
A program that neatly packages FFmpeg (among other tools) into a singular, easy-to-use application.

This project is inspired by QuirtTheDirt's mTool, which has a similar purpose. However, this program will offer slightly different features and quality-of-life changes that make the program more user-friendly.

This program is in alpha and will be updated consistently until I decide it's been completed to the best of my ability. Updates may come often, but they may not. Heck, I might not even finish this thing. This is mostly a fun project that I'll have great use for.

Features:
  - Download videos from virtually anywhere on the internet so long as you have the video's url
  - Convert videos to other video types such as .mp4, .webm, and .avi
  - Convert audio to other audio types such as .wav, .mp3, and .ogg
  - Convert photos to other photo types such as .jpg, .png, and .gif
  - Compress photos and videos to a specific file size or resolution
  - Extract audio from video
